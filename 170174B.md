# Lessons Learned

- Blockchain network consists of a distributed ledger which records transactions happening on the network. In Hyperledger Fabric a ledger has a world state and a blockchain. In the example app we created, we had 6 assets. There, the world state contained the states corresponding to the assets and the blockchain contained the linked blocks with transactions corresponding to the initial states in world state.

- Smart Contracts provides business logic for the blockchain network. In Hyperledger Fabric framework smart contracts are implemented using Chaincode. In Hyperledger Fabric we can also use chaincode to specify assets and implement logic to manage them.
